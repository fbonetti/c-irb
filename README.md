# Getting started

This short script is written in Ruby, so you will need to install it if you haven't already. Navigate to the folder containing `cirb.rb` and enter the following:

```ruby
ruby cirb.rb
```

You will now be able to enter C commands.

```C
int num = 39842; printf("%d", num);
```

Will output `39842`

That's it!

# Limitations

* Only works on windows
* State is not saved between commands
